# Roadmap to setup your own ProteomicsQC server

In order to run the server on a specific domain you have to register the domain
and point it to the public IP address of your server. Furthermore, you have to 
setup a remote proxy to redirect HTTP and HTTPS requests to port 8080. 
For security reasons you should always use HTTPS.
