> In order to run the server on a specific domain you have to register the domain
> and point it to the public IP address of your server. Furthermore, you have to 
> setup a remote proxy to redirect HTTP and HTTPS requests to port 8080. 
> For security reasons you should always use HTTPS. The server was tested using
