ProteomicsQCâ€¯is a Quality Control server for quantiative proteomics with a special emphasis on simplicity and accessibility in a distributed computational environment.

Scientists can login, submit files, and explore the results remotely. The software features automatic sample processing for multiple projects by simple drag and drop of proteomics RAW files into a web frontend, an interactive dashboard that integrates machine learning powered explainable anomaly detection, and an API for automated/programmatic access and extensibility.  

- You can find the software repository on [Github](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ProteomicsQC).
- And a running version on [ResistanceDB](https://proteomics.resistancedb.org).
